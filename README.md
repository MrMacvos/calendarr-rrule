Based on:
 		https://github.com/ZContent/icalendar/blob/master/includes/recurringdate.php
and because that one only works half, I made this one.

This version parses all examples from
		https://icalendar.org/iCalendar-RFC-5545/3-8-5-3-recurrence-rule.html
correctly, except for SETPOS. I did not implement that one.
